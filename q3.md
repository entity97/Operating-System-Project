Deadlock detection is an important aspect of the operating system design that involves determining whether or not a set of processes is deadlocked. A deadlock occurs when two or more processes are waiting for each other to release resources resulting in a situation where neither process can proceed. 

As given in the question, two techniques are commonly used to detect deadlocks in a system:

Cycle Detection: This involves traversing the graph of processes and resources and determining whether there is a cycle in the graph. A cycle in the graph indicates that there is a possibility of a deadlock. This procedure is simple and fast but it may not always detect deadlocks accurately.

Resource Allocation Graph: This procedure involves creating a resource allocation graph and checking to see if all of a process’s needs can be met. If all of a process’s needs can be satisfied, the process is repeated until there are no processes left in the graph. If any process remains after this procedure, it indicates that the system is deadlocked. 

In both of these procedures, it is important to keep track of the resources held by each process and the resources available in the system. This information is used to identify and resolve deadlocks. 

In the given example, 
The number of resource instances and processes = 3


Allocation         Max        Available Resources          
3 3 3		3 6 8 		1 2 0
2 0 3		4 3 3 
1 2 4		3 4 4


Max - Allocation comes down to 
0 3 5
2 3 0
2 2 0

These all exceed the available resources in the example hence, they are waiting for resources causing a deadlock.
